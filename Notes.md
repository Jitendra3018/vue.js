# Vue JS

**1. What is Vue.js?**
    Vue.js is the JS framework for building applications and websites.
    a. Vue is generally used to create single-page applications that run on the client, but can be used to create full-stack applications by making HTTP requests to a backend server. Vue is possible with Node.js and Express.js (MEVN stack)
    b. Vue can also run on the server-side by using a SSR framework like Nuxt.

**2. How Vue can help?**
    a. It provides tools out of the box to help you make your websites and apps faster and more dynamic.
    b. It gives a set of standards for "Code Organization" and expectations for individual and teams that work in the same code-base.
    c. Speed of Development
    d. Developer Tools
    e. Helps with Scaling

**3. Features and Benefits**
    a. Vue.js is the Virtual DOM (It makes the JS applications or websites more faster and efficient) based framework.
    b. It is extremely lightweight (10K gzip)
    c. It is progressive (It means that we can use it anywhere from small features on the websites where we want to add some interactivity and using it kind of dropping and replacement of the jQuery and legacy applications all the way up to using it as a full featured batteries included framework for large scale applications like gmail, twitter or some other social media apps)
    d. We get to decide, what features we need to have from the vue ecosystem beyond the core libraries.
    e. It is extremely flexible to allow you to choose the tools and other libraries you want on ur own or we can use the one that vue provides with it's ecosystem by default.

**4. Working with State/Data**
    a. Components can have their own state which can determine how a specific component behaves and what data it displays.
    b. Some state may be local to a specific component and some may be "global" or 'app' level tate that needs to be shared with multiple components.
    c. Vuex is a state manager for global state in larger applications.

**5. Options API vs. Composition API**
    a. Vue 3 has the composition API, which aims to address code reusability and readability in Vue 3, especially in larger applications.
